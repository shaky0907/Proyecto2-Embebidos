<p>Most Simics modules contain some code written in Python. The most common uses of Python are to extend Simics with new CLI commands, as discussed in chapter <a class="reference" href="new-commands.html">13</a>, and to write component modules, as discussed in chapter <a class="reference" href="device-modeling-overview.html#components">4.4</a>.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>Python and Simics use conflicting nomenclature around the module concept. A <em>Python module</em> is a single Python file, and a <em>Python package</em> is a directory that contains multiple related Python modules. A <em>Simics module</em> can contain multiple Python files; thereby, it roughly corresponds to a Python package. Furthermore, a Python package should not be confused with a <em>Simics add-on package</em>. </p>
</div>
<p>Python code is added to a Simics module by adding filenames to the <code>PYTHON_FILES</code> variable in the module's <code>Makefile</code>. The listed files are compiled into <code>.pyc</code> files, placed in the directory <code>[host]/lib/python/simmod/simics_module_name</code>, where <em>simics_module_name</em> is the name of the Simics module, with hyphens replaced with underscores. The <code>.pyc</code> files are then available as submodules of the <code>simmod.simics_module_name</code> Python package. As an example, consider a Simics module named <code>my-module</code>, which contains the following in its <code>Makefile</code>: </p>
<pre><code>  PYTHON_FILES = common.py module_load.py simics_start.py
</code></pre>
<p>The Python module defined by common.py can then be imported from Simics as follows: </p>
<pre><code>  import simmod.my_module.common
</code></pre>
<p>Two filenames in <code>PYTHON_FILES</code> have special meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>A file named <code>simics_start.py</code> will be automatically loaded when Simics starts. </li>
<li>A file named <code>module_load.py</code> will be automatically loaded when the Simics module is loaded. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the filename <code>checkpoint_update.py</code> is reserved for future use, and not permitted.</p>
<p>It is possible to create a nested directory structure in <code>PYTHON_FILES</code>. This works as in standard Python; i.e., each subdirectory must contain a file <code>__init__.py</code>. Thus, the following will create a subpackage <code>sub</code> with a submodule <code>common</code>: </p>
<pre><code>  PYTHON_FILES = sub/__init__.py sub/common.py
</code></pre>
<p>The Python module <code>sub/common.py</code> can then be imported as follows:</p>
<pre><code>  import simmod.my_module.sub.common
</code></pre>
<div class="note">
<p>Module tests that are written in Python should <em>not</em> be included in the <code>PYTHON_FILES</code> variable; the test framework automatically finds and runs tests directly under the module's source directory.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="python-in-older-versions-of-simics">12.1 <a href="#python-in-older-versions-of-simics">Python in older versions of Simics</a></h2>
<p>Before the <code>PYTHON_FILES</code> variable was supported, there were two different mechanisms for using Python in modules. Both mechanisms are deprecated, and will be removed in future Simics versions. They are briefly explained here because they may appear in existing source code:</p>
<ul>
<li>If files named <code>gcommands.py</code> and <code>commands.py</code> are found in the same directory as the module's <code>Makefile</code>, then they are run when Simics is started and when the module is loaded, respectively. This mechanism is only supported for modules with <code>SIMICS_API</code> set to 4.8 or older. </li>
<li>If Python files are listed in the <code>SRC_FILES</code> variable, one Simics module is created for each such source file; module metadata is declared using Python comments on certain forms. It is an error to both specify <code>PYTHON_FILES</code> and list Python files in <code>SRC_FILES</code>. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="importing-python-modules-within-a-simics-module">12.2.1 <a href="#importing-python-modules-within-a-simics-module">Importing Python modules within a Simics module</a></h3>
<p>When a Python module imports another Python module in the same Simics module, the recommended practice is to use an <em>explicit relative import</em>:</p>
<pre><code>from . import common
from .common import utility
</code></pre>
<p>or, alternatively, to use the more verbose <em>absolute import</em>:</p>
<pre><code>import simmod.my_module.common
from simmod.my_module.common import utility
</code></pre>
<p>Python permits a third variant of imports, called <em>implicit relative imports</em>, which should be avoided in this case:</p>
<pre><code>import common   # BAD!
</code></pre>
<p>This notation is bad because an implicit relative import can easily be mistaken for an absolute import. Implicit relative imports have been removed in recent versions of the Python language.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-python-code-between-simics-modules">12.2.2 <a href="#sharing-python-code-between-simics-modules">Sharing Python code between Simics modules</a></h3>
<p>There are two ways to share Python code between modules. In most cases, the best way is to list the shared file in the <code>PYTHON_FILES</code> variable of all modules. Use the <code>EXTRA_MODULE_VPATH</code> variable (see <a class="reference" href="build-environment.html#module-makefiles">3.5.3</a>) to make sure the file is found by Make. One copy of the shared Python file will be created in each Simics module using it, and each copy will act as an independent Python module in Simics.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a single instance of a Python module can be shared between multiple Simics modules using absolute imports. While this approach may appear simpler, it is also risky, because it places very high compatibility requirements on the ABI exposed by the shared module. Using an absolute import to access shared code from a different module is therefore discouraged in general, and should only be done if you fully understand the consequences. The following example demonstrates how a seemingly innocent change can cause compatibility problems:</p>
<p>Let's say that a configuration attribute is added in a new version of a model A, and that a CLI command defined in shared code reads from this attribute. Furthermore, let's say that the shared code is also used by a model B, distributed in a different Simics add-on package, and that the shared code is distributed in both packages. Now, suppose that we use an <em>old</em> version of package A, where the new attribute has not been added, together with a <em>new</em> version of package B, where the attribute has been added. Simics will pick the version of the shared code from B for both modules; this means that the CLI command defined by the shared code will try to access a nonexisting attribute, causing unintended errors.</p>
<h3 id="side-effects-in-modules">12.2.3 <a href="#side-effects-in-modules">Side-effects in modules</a></h3>
<p>It is generally considered good design to avoid side-effects when merely importing a Python module. In Simics, the <code>module_load</code> and <code>simics_start</code> modules must have side-effects, usually in the form of class or command registration, in order to be meaningful. However, for large Simics modules it is recommended to keep these files small, and keep most implementation in other Python files. For example, let's say a module defines <code>info</code> and <code>status</code> commands for the three devices <code>my-uart</code>, <code>my-pic</code> and <code>my-timer</code>. Then it can make sense to define command callbacks in a separate file, say <code>command_defs.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def uart_status(obj): […]
def uart_info(obj): […]
def pic_status(obj): […] 
def pic_info(obj): […] 
def timer_status(obj): […] 
def timer_info(obj): […]

def register_commands(prefix):
    cli.register_status_command(prefix + 'uart', uart_status)
    cli.register_info_command(prefix + 'uart', uart_info)
    cli.register_status_command(prefix + 'pic', pic_status)
    cli.register_info_command(prefix + 'pic', pic_info)
    cli.register_status_command(prefix + 'timer', timer_status)
    cli.register_info_command(prefix + 'timer', timer_info)
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>module_load.py</code> can be implemented as follows:</p>
<pre><code>from . import command_defs
command_defs.register_commands('my-')
</code></pre>
<p>One advantage of this approach is code reuse: If another Simics module <code>your-module</code> contains models of similar hardware, say <code>your-uart</code>, <code>your-pic</code> and <code>your-timer</code>, then the <code>command_defs.py</code> file can be shared between the Simics modules. After editing the <code>PYTHON_FILES</code> and <code>EXTRA_MODULE_VPATH</code> variables in the <code>Makefile</code> of <code>your-module</code>, as discussed in section <a class="reference" href="#sharing-python-code-between-simics-modules">12.2.2</a>, <code>module_load.py</code> can be implemented just like in <code>my-module</code>: </p>
<pre><code>from . import command_defs
command_defs.register_commands('your-')
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>register_commands</code> function may have to be parameterized differently, depending on how the <code>your-</code> and <code>my-</code> models differ.</p>
