<h1 id="advanced-programming-with-dml">9 <a href="#advanced-programming-with-dml">Advanced Programming with DML</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to describe some advanced DML topics which may be needed when writing larger and more complex device models. It assumes that you already know the basics of DML programming.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-simics-api">9.1 <a href="#using-the-simics-api">Using the Simics API</a></h2>
<p>The Simics API is a set of C functions and data types. These can be used by DML code directly by calling the functions as in C. No <code>call</code> or <code>inline</code> is used to call API functions.</p>
<p>The <em>device API</em> is automatically available in DML, other parts of the Simics is available by importing API definition files. See section <em>The Simics API</em> in <em>API Reference Manual</em> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="embedding-c-code">9.2 <a href="#embedding-c-code">Embedding C Code</a></h2>
<p>Since data types and method bodies in DML are written in an extended subset of C, you can easily call C functions from DML by using normal function call syntax. So <code>f(x)</code> is a call to the function <code>f</code> with the argument <code>x</code>, and <code>call</code> or <code>inline</code> is not used.</p>
<p>To be able to use types and symbols from C code that is linked with the DML-generated code, the DML code needs to know about them. This is done by using <code>extern</code> declarations. Just like in C, a function (or variable) can be declared as extern, meaning that it is defined in a different compilation unit.</p>
<pre><code>extern int fib(int x);
</code></pre>
<p>When importing a C typedef into DML, an <code>extern typedef</code> is used.</p>
<pre><code>extern typedef struct {
    int x;
} mystruct;
</code></pre>
<p>This tells the DML compiler that the generated C code can use a struct typedef that has a field called <code>x</code> which is an <code>int</code>. Note that the DML does not know anything about the actual in-memory data layout of this struct, and there may even be other fields in the struct in the real type (as defined in C). This means that it is possible to define opaque struct typedefs like this:</p>
<pre><code>extern typedef struct { } opaque_data;
extern void f(opaque_data *data);
</code></pre>
<p>Enumerated types in C and the constants defined by them can be imported in DML in a similar fashion with the <code>extern</code> keyword. For example, suppose a C header file includes the following definition:</p>
<pre><code>typedef enum process_type {
     SMALL = 1,
     MEDIUM,
     BIG
} process_type_t;
</code></pre>
<p>To import this definition into DML, each of the names has to be introduced by a separate <code>extern</code> declaration at the top level. One way of achieving this is:</p>
<pre><code>extern typedef int process_type_t;
extern const process_type_t SMALL;
extern const process_type_t MEDIUM;
extern const process_type_t BIG;
</code></pre>
<p>To be able to use the external types and symbols, it is not enough to import their definitions into DML. It is also necessary to add C code that includes these definitions to the files that the DML compiler generates. This is done by using <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code> in the DML code. Both take blocks of C code that is included verbatim in the generated output. The difference is that the header code goes at the top of the output and the footer goes to the bottom. The most typical use is to have an <code>#include</code> statement of a C header file inside a <code>header</code> block and the implementation in a separate C file. If a local support function needs to be implemented in C, the best way is usually to add a prototype in the header and the function implementation in the footer.</p>
<p>Below is an example of a DML model that uses embedded C code. It is based on the simple memory mapped device described in section <a class="reference" href="device-modeling-overview.html">4</a>:</p>
<p>
</p><pre><code>dml 1.4;
device simple_embedded;
param documentation = "Embedding C code example for"
    + " Model Builder User's Guide";
param desc = "example of C code";

extern int fib(int x);

bank regs {
    register r0 size 4 @0x0000 is (read, write) {
        method write(uint64 val) {
            log info: "Fibonacci(%d) = %d.", val, fib(val);
        }

        method read() -&gt; (uint64) {
            // Must be implemented to compile
            return 0;
        }
    }
}

header %{
int fib(int x);
%}

footer %{
int fib(int x) {
    if (x &lt; 2) return 1;
    else return fib(x-1) + fib(x-2);
}
%}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>Writing to the (pseudo-) register <code>r0</code> has the effect of printing a log message with the computed Fibonacci number: </p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">simics&gt; <strong>phys_mem.write 0x1000 6 -l</strong>
[dev1 info] Fibonacci(6) = 13.
</code></pre>
<p>Notable points are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The C identifier <code>fib</code> is declared in DML using a top-level <code>extern</code> declaration. </li>
<li>The section <code>footer %{ … %}</code> is appended verbatim to the C program generated by the DML compiler (<code>dmlc</code>). Its contents are not examined in any way by <code>dmlc</code>. </li>
<li>Similarly, the <code>header %{ … %}</code> section is included verbatim at the beginning of the program generated by <code>dmlc</code>. </li>
<li>It is normally better to place C functions in separately compiled files, if possible, and link with the generated DML code. (To do this, you need to modify the Makefile for the module.) </li>
<li>The function declaration must be included in the header section as well as being declared <code>extern</code> in DML. They are usually identical, but not always, and thus the C declaration is not automatically generated by <code>dmlc</code>; this could change in future DML revisions. </li>
<li>Header and footer sections could become deprecated or removed in future versions of DML. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Device part of the Simics API (a set of C functions and data types) is always available in DML. Other parts of the Simics API can also be included as described in section <em>The Simics API</em> in <em>API Reference Manual</em> documentation.</p>
<p>For example, this is how the method <code>set_read_value()</code> is implemented in the standard library. It updates a <code>generic_transaction_t</code> structure (a "memory operation") at the end of a read access to a memory bank has finished, depending on the endianness of the bank:</p>
<pre><code>method set_read_value(generic_transaction_t *memop, uint64 value) default {
    #if (!defined byte_order)
        error "undefined byte order";
    #else #if (byte_order == "little-endian")
        SIM_set_mem_op_value_le(memop, value);
    #else #if (byte_order == "big-endian")
        SIM_set_mem_op_value_be(memop, value);
    #else
        error "bad value for parameter 'byte_order'";
}
</code></pre>
<p>The sample code in <code>[simics]/src/devices/sample-device-mixed</code> has more examples.</p>
<h2 id="calling-back-from-c">9.3 <a href="#calling-back-from-c">Calling Back From C</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes it is also necessary to call DML code from external code. The best way to do this is by defining a Simics interface to the DML device and then using that from the C code. The sample code in <code>[simics]/src/devices/sample-device-mixed</code> shows how it can be done:</p>
<p>
</p><pre><code>typedef struct {
        void (*one)(conf_object_t *obj);
        void (*two)(conf_object_t *obj, uint32 count);
} myinterface_interface_t;

implement myinterface {
    method one() {
        log info: "ONE";
    }
    method two(uint32 count) {
        log info: "TWO %u", count;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>The above defines a model-specific interface and implements it. The interface definition is a struct of function pointers, just like all Simics interfaces. The interface struct type will be part of the generated C code, which means that it can be used by other C code generated by DMLC. For code included in a <code>footer</code> block, it is automatically known.</p>
<p>The C code that wants to call the interface needs to use <code>SIM_c_get_interface</code> to get the function pointers to use.</p>
<p>
</p><pre><code>void call_out_to_c(conf_object_t *obj) {
        const myinterface_interface_t *iface =
                SIM_c_get_interface(obj, "myinterface");
        ASSERT(iface);
        iface-&gt;one(obj);
        iface-&gt;two(obj, 4711);
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>It is not necessary to do this every time, the return value from <code>SIM_c_get_interface</code> can, and should, be cached.</p>
<h2 id="integrating-with-c">9.4 <a href="#integrating-with-c">Integrating with C++</a></h2>
<p>The DML compiler generates C code, and this means that it integrates well with anything that C integrates well with. This includes C++ functions and types declared with <code>extern "C"</code>. It is not possible to call ordinary C++ functions or methods directly, but it is simple to create C wrappers in the C++ code and make sure they are declared with <code>extern "C"</code>.</p>
<h2 id="dividing-a-device-into-classes">9.5 <a href="#dividing-a-device-into-classes">Dividing a Device into Classes</a></h2>
<p>Large devices often consist of several logical units. The best way to know if the device should be divided in logical units is to look at the device specification. Logical units are often mapped to specific physical memory address regions, or their registers are grouped together. We call these register groups <code>banks</code>.</p>
<p>An example of a device with many logical units is a system controller. A system controller can include a memory controller, a watchdog, an interrupt controller, an Ethernet controller, etc. This makes it a good candidate to cut in pieces. On the other hand, devices with few registers should be left in one piece, as several classes makes it a bit harder to instantiate a working device in the simulator.</p>
<p>The first major decision when modeling a large device in DML is how to divide the device in easily manageable parts. There are basically two ways to model a large device with several logical units in Simics. This is discussed in section <a class="reference" href="#one-class-only">9.5.1</a> and <a class="reference" href="#one-class-for-each-logical-unit">9.5.2</a>.</p>
<h3 id="one-class-only">9.5.1 <a href="#one-class-only">One Class Only</a></h3>
<p>The first way to model a device comprising several logical units is to include all functionality in a single class.</p>
<p>The major advantage of not splitting up a device is to simplify the internal communication between the logical units. All logical units can directly access other units. If they were divided into separate classes, specific interfaces would need to be created for the units to communicate.</p>
<p>For example, a system controller often contains an interrupt unit which forwards all interrupts to the CPU. Each logical unit must be able to access internal registers or functions in the interrupt unit to generate its interrupts. A device divided in several logical units will require an interrupt interface between the interrupt controller and all other logical units.</p>
<p>Another advantage of not splitting up a device is to simplify the system setup. All internal communication for a divided device must be set up in scripts or components. Logical units must have connections to other logical units to know which unit to communicate with. The setup for external connections can also increase when dividing a device. Several classes may need connections to the same objects, such as memory spaces. A device built in one class needs only one connection.</p>
<p>To put it simply: fewer classes make for fewer connections, which simplifies the setup phase.</p>
<p>It is recommended to create one bank for each logical unit. Each bank should be defined in its own DML file. Here is an example how to divide a device in several files without splitting the device in classes.</p>
<p><strong>Makefile</strong></p>
<p>
</p><pre><code>MODULE_CLASSES := system_controller

SRC_FILES := system_controller.dml

SIMICS_API := latest
THREAD_SAFE = yes

include $(MODULE_MAKEFILE)
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p><strong>system_controller.dml</strong></p>
<p>
</p><pre><code>// System Controller
dml 1.4;

device system_controller;
param desc = "system controller";
param documentation = "The " + name + " device implements a system controller";

import "sdram_controller.dml";
import "interrupt_controller.dml";
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p><strong>sdram_controller.dml</strong></p>
<p>
</p><pre><code>// SDRAM controller logical unit
dml 1.4;

loggroup lg_sdram;

bank sdram_controller {
    param log_group = lg_sdram;

    // more code ....

    register r size 4 is unmapped;

    // more code ....
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p><strong>interrupt_controller.dml</strong></p>
<p>
</p><pre><code>dml 1.4;

loggroup lg_interrupt;

import "utility.dml";

bank interrupt_controller {
    param log_group = lg_interrupt;

    // more code ...

    register a size 4 @ 0x0 is read "The a register" {
        method read() -&gt; (uint64) {
            log info, 2, lg_interrupt: "reading register a";
            return 7411;
        }
    }
    register b size 4 @ 0x4 is read_only "The b register";
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>Note that the example code uses explicit log-groups for each logical unit. It helps when debugging the device.</p>
<p>It is possible to set up the logging to handle log-messages from a specific log-group only, suppressing log-messages from other groups that otherwise would have made debugging harder. This is not a problem for devices divided in several classes. Each class is a separate log-object with its own log-level and log-group.</p>
<h3 id="one-class-for-each-logical-unit">9.5.2 <a href="#one-class-for-each-logical-unit">One Class for Each Logical Unit</a></h3>
<p>The second way to model a device with several logical units is to create one class for each logical unit.</p>
<p>The major advantage of this approach is the option to combine several classes to form new devices. A device family can consist of several devices that are almost identical, but where several logical units have been replaced; one device can include a Fast Ethernet controller, another a Gigabit Ethernet controller. Hardware vendors often have one IP-block for each logical unit and they combine the blocks to create a updated device. The same thing can be done with Simics classes. A device split in classes only requires a script file to create a new device. Otherwise you have to create a new Simics module for the new device, but you can reuse the code for an already existing device by letting the two devices share the code. Section <a class="reference" href="#device-sharing-dml-code">9.6</a> explains how to share DML code.</p>

<h2 id="device-sharing-dml-code">9.6 <a href="#device-sharing-dml-code">Device Sharing DML Code</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to share DML code between devices in Simics. Simics also include generic DML code to create various type of devices. For example, PCI devices in Simics are easy to write in DML using the standard PCI device code. Several PCI devices share the same PCI code. The common PCI code defines a couple of templates that can be combined and configured according to the model needs. PCI devices in DML is described in the Technology Guide "PCIe Modeling Library"</p>
<p>There are several ways to write your own shared code. Make sure the shared code use the default statement on functions and parameters to allow the implementing devices to override them. The most common ways of writing shared code are listed below, including short code examples referring to the example code later in this section.</p>
<div class="dl">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="dt:redefine-object"><em>redefine object</em></span><br>
Two or more devices can share the same code but define objects differently. Common objects in DML are <code>banks</code>, <code>registers</code>, <code>fields</code>, <code>connects</code>, <code>implements</code>, <code>attributes</code>, <code>groups</code>, and <code>events</code>.</p>
<p>The bank defines <code>registers</code>, but the registers can differ between devices sharing the same code. Device specific registers are defined in the devices and the common registers in the shared code.</p>
<p>The register definition can be different between devices. The register is declared in the shared code but defined in the device code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="dt:parameter"><em>parameter</em></span><br>
Setting a parameter to default makes it possible to override it. A default parameter in the shared code can for instance define a register start offset. The devices importing the shared code file can override the parameter to change the offset. Setting a parameter to <code>default undefined</code> forces the device to define the parameter the compiler will otherwise complain when building the device. Note that you can only override a parameter once. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="dt:shared-templates-used-by-device-specific-objects"><em>shared templates used by device specific objects</em></span><br>
Defining a template in the shared code makes it possible for the template to be used across several objects in the specific devices. The DML library contains a lot of common templates, but you can also define your own. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="dt:shared-code-using-device-specific-templates"><em>shared code using device specific templates</em></span><br>
Using undefined templates in the shared code makes it possible for each implementation to define its own variant. Different devices can define the template in different ways using the same shared code. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="dt:method"><em>method</em></span><br>
Shared code can define default methods that can be overridden by devices. It is then up to the device to override methods when it is necessary to implement new functionality. Note that you can only override a function once. </p>
</li>
</ul>
