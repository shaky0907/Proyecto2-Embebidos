<h2 id="instrumentation-api-overview">40.1 <a href="#instrumentation-api-overview">Instrumentation API Overview</a></h2>
<p>Simics instrumentation framework defines a set of new interfaces that could be used to add instrumentation. Most of these are optional by the design. In principle, the only interface that must be used for instrumentation to show up in the <code>list-instrumentation</code> command are some Python functions in Simics' <code>instrumentation</code> module.</p>
<p>Currently, the only supported interface for implementing instrumentation tools is to use the <code>instrumentation.make_tool_commands()</code> python function. This makes it easier to write instrumentation tools, and to automatically implement a number of standard commands for those. These commands will automatically interface the <code>instrumentation</code> "database" which keeps track of currently used instrumentation (tools, providers and filters objects connected).</p>
<p>This factory function should be called from the tool's <code>simics_start.py</code> file, which is automatically run when Simics starts. The <code>instrumentation.make_tool_commands()</code> function takes many arguments (allowing customization on which commands that should be created), but only a few arguments are actually required.</p>
<p>A tool which make use of the <code>instrumentation.make_tool_commands()</code> function, must implement the <code>instrumentation_tool</code> interface. The <code>instrumentation_tool.connect()</code> method should return an object pointer with the associated data-structure for the connection. As shown in figure <a class="reference" href="#api-ex1">16</a> and figure <a class="reference" href="#api-ex2">17</a> </p>

<figcaption>Figure 17. Multiple connections</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>By having a dedicated object for each connection, the tool will more easily be able to handle simultaneous calls from providers that execute in different threads in Simics. This requires that each connection maintains its own connection specific data (and not access any connection global data). The tool can then fetch the connection specific data from all connections and merge these into a unified view for the complete result of all connections.</p>
<p>If a connection is about to be removed, the <code>instrumentation_tool.disconnect()</code> function is called. This requests the tool to un-register the connection from the provider and to remove the associated connection object, as illustrated in figure <a class="reference" href="#api-ex4">19</a>.</p>
<figure id="api-ex3">
<p><img alt="" src="api-ex3.png"></p>
<figcaption>Figure 18. Disconnecting a tool from a provider</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>When a connection is created, the framework also creates an additional small Simics object of the <code>instrumentation_filter_aggregator</code> class. This object is what the filters communicate with, when enabling/disabling each connection. The aggregator will look at all sources and control enabling and disabling with the <code>instrumentation_connection</code> interface. The filter implements the <code>instrumentation_filter_master</code> interface and talks to the aggregator via the <code>instrumentation_filter_slave</code> interface. See figure <a class="reference" href="#api-ex4">19</a>.</p>

<p>Instrumentation setup is regarded as per session, that is, the connected instrumentation is not saved in any checkpoints. This means that the user will need to re-establish the instrumentation connections when starting from a checkpoint. All instrumentation tools and filters should set <code>class_data_t.kind = Sim_Class_Kind_Pseudo</code>. </p>

<h2 id="tool-and-connection-api">40.2 <a href="#tool-and-connection-api">Tool and Connection API</a></h2>
<p>The API functions and interfaces that a tool should use are located in the <code>simics/simulator-iface/instrumentation-tool.h</code> header file.</p>
<p>To get started writing an new instrumentation tool, a skeleton can be created by running the following command in the project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">   $ <strong>cd my-project</strong>
   my-project$ <strong>./bin/project-setup --instrumentation-tool my_tool</strong>
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new <code>modules/my_tool</code> directory containing associated required files. Search for <code>USER-TODO</code> markers in the generated files for a description on what, and where, additional logic needs to be inserted. It can also be useful to take a look at the distributed source files of example tools, that are included in the package.</p>
<h3 id="multithreading-aspects">40.2.1 <a href="#multithreading-aspects">Multithreading Aspects</a></h3>
<p>Tools can be called simultaneously from providers in different executing threads. It is up to the tool to handle this parallelism itself. The tool has some choices how to handle multi-threading:</p>
<ul>
<li>In all callbacks, only access data which are associated with a specific connection, i.e., the connection object. This is safe since a provider will only reside in one thread. This is the recommended approach.</li>
<li>Make the tool multi-threading capable, protecting accesses to any shared resources with locks, atomic operations, etc. </li>
<li>Detect if providers are in different cells and refuse to support it. </li>
<li>Enforce that any multi-threading simulation is turned off, in order to use the tool. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instrumentation-filter-api">40.3 <a href="#instrumentation-filter-api">Instrumentation Filter API</a></h2>
<p>The interfaces needed to design a filter is located in the <code>simics/simulator-iface/instrumentation-filter.h</code> header file.</p>
<p>To get started writing an new instrumentation filter, a skeleton can be created by running the following command in a project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-simics">   $ <strong>cd my-project</strong>
   my-project$ <strong>./bin/project-setup --instrumentation-filter my_filter</strong>
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new <code>modules/my_filter</code> directory containing associated required files. Search for <code>USER-TODO</code> markers in the generated files for a description on what, and where, additional logic needs to be inserted. It can also be useful to take a look at the distributed source files of example filters, that are included in the package.</p>
<p>A filter must implement the <code>instrumentation_filter_master</code> interface and drive the <code>instrumentation_filter_slave</code> interface for the slaves it has been assigned. The slaves are <code>instrumentation_filter_aggregator</code> objects which are automatically created when a connection is created.</p>
<p>When a filter object is created, it must first be assigned a session-unique "source-id". This can be retrieved from the python <code>instrumentation.get_filter_source</code> function. This can be achieved from the filter's <code>simics_start.py</code> file, which should contain a command for creating the filter. Once the object has been created, the python code could inform its source-id to the filter by calling the <code>instrumentation_filter_master.set_source_id</code> function.</p>
<p>The <code>instrumentation_filter_master.add/remove_slave</code> functions will be called when ever <code>&lt;tool&gt;.add-filter</code> is adding this tool, or when additional connections are added or removed from the tool.</p>
<p>Note that filters could be assigned slaves located in different cells (executing in different threads). It is up to the filter to handle this, for example by not supporting it, to avoid strange threading problems. This can be achieved by returning <code>false</code> in the <code>add_slave</code> method when the <code>provider_obj</code> is located in a different cell than previous slaves.</p>
<p>How a filter enables/disables the slaves is up to the filter. There are some scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>The filter itself listens to the corresponding provider as the slave's provider object, and only enable/disable the corresponding connection based on this. This would be safe from a threading point of view even if the providers are located in different cells. </li>
<li>The filter gets stimuli from something else and enables or disables all slaves at the same time. </li>
<li>A combination of the above. Known providers' connections are enabled/disabled when something happens on those. The "unknown" listeners can be all enabled/disabled when one or all providers are in a certain state. </li>
</ul>
<p>Figure <a class="reference" href="#api-ex6">21</a> show how a filter reacts on a provider and only enables/disables the slave which is associated with the same provider. </p>
<figure id="api-ex6">
<p><img alt="" src="api-ex6.png"></p>
<figcaption>Figure 21. Thread-safe filtering</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>In figure <a class="reference" href="#api-ex7">22</a>, however, the filter tries to enable/disable connections in two different cells. This could potentially crash. If cross-cell filtering is needed, the connection in the other cell must be relayed through a <code>SIM_run_alone()</code> function, which will be delayed and invoked when it is safe to do cross-cell calls.</p>

<h2 id="provider-api">40.4 <a href="#provider-api">Provider API</a></h2>
<p>How the actual communication between a provider and tool should be achieved, must be designed case by case. The instrumentation framework itself, does not have any specific requirements on this. When a new provider interface needs to be designed, it is recommended to re-use design philosophies and naming schemes from already existing interfaces, keeping provider interfaces as consistent as possible.</p>
<p>In some way, the tool must inform the provider that it wants to get instrumentation information. Typically there are two designs for this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Callback based</strong>. The provider implements an interface which offers callback functions to be registered, one function per particular feature the provider provides. The callbacks are invoked by the provider when something interesting happens in the provider. </li>
<li><strong>Interface based</strong>. The provider implements a simple interface which can register connection objects. The provider could then detect which interfaces that exists in the tool connection and based of this, later invoke corresponding interface calls towards the tool connection's interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two generic interfaces can be implemented in the provider (when found useful):</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>instrumentation_order</strong> interface, which allows the user to change the dispatch order for registered tool connections with the generic <code>instrumentation-order</code> and <code>instrumentation-move</code> commands. </li>
<li>A callback based provider can implement the <strong>callback_info</strong> interface, which allows the generic <code>list-instrumentation-callbacks</code> command to list callbacks that has been installed in the provider. </li>
</ul>
<p>These interfaces are located in the <code>simics/model-iface/instrumentation-provider.h</code> header file.</p>
<h3 id="cpu-instrumentation-api">40.4.1 <a href="#cpu-instrumentation-api">CPU Instrumentation API</a></h3>
<p>Simics CPU instrumentation is provided on top of the generic instrumentation framework, where the processor model acts as a instrumentation provider. This chapter describes Simics' processor instrumentation API.</p>
<p>A tool that wants to connect to the CPU instrumentation and use the <code>instrumentation.make_tool_commands</code> function must set the <em>provider_requirements</em> argument to <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code>, and maybe more interfaces.</p>
<p>The <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code> interface is the main interface used, but there are also other interfaces that must be used in certain circumstances as a consequence of some of the callbacks. Figure <a class="reference" href="#cpu-api-ex1">23</a> shows some of the interfaces that are used.</p>
<p>Note, not all CPU-models support all parts of the CPU Instrumentation API.</p>
<figure id="cpu-api-ex1">
<p><img alt="" src="cpu-api-ex1.png"></p>
<figcaption>Figure 23. CPU instrumentation interfaces</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>A processor does not require any implemented interfaces from a tool, instead a tool will subscribe for information from a processor and register function callbacks which are invoked when the subscribed feature is triggered on a processor.</p>
<p>The interface can be used in two different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The instrumentation framework, where the supplied connection object acts as a container for all registered callbacks. This allows all callbacks to be moved in dispatch order, compared to other connections. It also makes it easier to control multiple callbacks since it it possible to disable, enable and remove all callbacks associated with a connection with one method call.</li>
<li>Or as simple callbacks, which is achieved by specifying <code>NULL</code> or <code>None</code>, in C or Python respectively, as connection pointer. This allows the interface to be used from a Python script, without the need to create Simics connection objects. With this setup, the user must control each callback by itself. When invoked, these callbacks will be called prior to the connection grouped callbacks, which also allows the processor model itself to be extended using the same interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>The interfaces used for the CPU instrumentation are located in the <code>simics/model-iface/cpu-instrumentation.h</code> header file. The architecture specific interfaces are located in <code>simics/arch/x86-instrumentation.h</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Subscribing to CPU instrumentation can be global (all instructions and/or memory accesses) or more carefully selected for each instruction at a time by the tool.</p>
<p>For example, assume a tool wants to monitor when certain instructions are executed. This can be done in different ways, each with pros and cons. The following list tries to highlight the workings of these different ways. </p>
<div class="dl">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="dt:with-global-instrumentation">With global instrumentation</span><br>
By registering a callback with the <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code> interface using the <code>register_instruction_before_cb()</code> method, the tool will get a callback for each instruction executed. If the tool is only looking for certain types of instructions, it would need to use the <code>cpu_instruction_query</code> interface's <code>get_instruction_bytes()</code> method and filter out the unwanted instructions. This will become very slow. See figure <a class="reference" href="#cpu-api-ex2a">24</a>. </p>
<figure id="cpu-api-ex2a">
<p><img alt="" src="cpu-api-ex2a.png"></p>
<figcaption>Figure 24. Using instruction callbacks</figcaption> 
  </figure>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term" id="dt:with-selective-instrumentation">With selective instrumentation</span><br>
The tool can filter out which instructions it wants to get a callback from more selectively. This is done by registering a callback with the <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code> interface using the <code>register_cached_instruction_cb()</code> method. The tool will now be called when each instruction is about to be cached in the CPU model's internal instruction cache (this is a Simics internal cache and not the same as the cache found on a real processor).</p>
<p>Just as before, the tools must decode what instruction that is about to be executed using the <code>cpu_instruction_query</code> interface's <code>get_instruction_bytes()</code> method. For the interesting instructions the tool can now register a dedicated callback using the <code>cpu_cached_instruction</code> interface's <code>register_instruction_before_cb()</code> method. Each cached instruction callback also carries a user-data pointer, which can be used by the callback. This means that the analysis is performed only once. There are, however, multiple reasons why this internal cache may be flushed, if that happens the instruction must be re-decoded.</p>
<p>Using the <code>cpu_cached_instruction</code> interface is much faster than filtering for an instruction of interest each time it is executed, since the callback will only be called for the requested instructions. See figure <a class="reference" href="#cpu-api-ex2b">25</a>.</p>

<p><span class="term" id="dt:with-a-counter">With a counter</span><br>
This is if the tool only wants to count how many times certain instructions are executed. The <code>cpu_cached_instruction</code> interface with the <code>add_counter</code> method, supports the fastest way to count instructions. Adding a pointer to a 64-bit counter for specific instruction means that the counter will increment each time this particular instruction is executed. This has very low overhead. See figure <a class="reference" href="#cpu-api-ex2c">26</a>. </p>
