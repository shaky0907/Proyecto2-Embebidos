<p>This is a technology preview of the packaging system for Simics. Everything here is subject to change without notice.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="creating-simics-packages"><a href="#creating-simics-packages">Creating Simics packages</a></h1>
<p>Simics packages are created using the script <code>bin/create-packages</code>. This
scripts takes a <em>package specification file</em> as input, and assembles files from
the local filesystem into a Simics package.</p>
<h2 id="package-specification-files"><a href="#package-specification-files">Package specification files</a></h2>
<p>A package specification file is a JSON file. A formal JSON validation scheme
for this file is available in the Simics base package, in the path
<code>scripts/package-specs-schema.json</code>.</p>
<p>The file describes a single object (i.e., <code>dict</code> in Python) on top level. The
object maps host-qualified package names, like <code>"Simics-Base-linux64"</code>, to
<em>package specifications</em>, where a package specification is an object with
string keys.</p>
<h2 id="required-properties-of-a-package-specification"><a href="#required-properties-of-a-package-specification">Required properties of a package specification</a></h2>
<h3 id="package-name-string"><a href="#package-name-string"><code>package-name</code> (string)</a></h3>
<p>Name identifier of the package, used for the install directory name.
The naming convention is <code>Camel-Kebab-Case</code>. e.g. <code>"Simics-Base"</code> or <code>"QSP"</code>.</p>
<h3 id="package-number-integer-or-null"><a href="#package-number-integer-or-null"><code>package-number</code> (integer or null)</a></h3>
<p>Package number. Must be globally unique. If null, the package cannot be
created; this can be useful for defining quasi-packages that never should be
shipped.</p>
<h3 id="name-string"><a href="#name-string"><code>name</code> (string)</a></h3>
<p>Name as a string, used e.g. for titles in UIs and documents. Often
<code>package-name</code> with dashes replaced with spaces.</p>
<h3 id="description-string"><a href="#description-string"><code>description</code> (string)</a></h3>
<p>One-line description of the package. Can be the empty string.</p>
<h3 id="host-string"><a href="#host-string"><code>host</code> (string)</a></h3>
<p>The host OS this package can be installed on. Must be <code>"linux64"</code> or <code>"win64"</code>.</p>
<h3 id="version-string"><a href="#version-string"><code>version</code> (string)</a></h3>
<p>Version, typically on the form <code>X.Y.Z</code> or <code>X.Y.preZ</code> where X, Y and Z are
integers.</p>
<h3 id="build-id-integer"><a href="#build-id-integer"><code>build-id</code> (integer)</a></h3>
<p>A number that should increase monotonically on every release. This number has
no technical significance for the package; in this context it is mainly useful
as a hint to the end-user to see which packages were released at the same time.
There is no global naming convention; some vendors use timestamps, others use
an integer that is incremented on every release.</p>
<h3 id="build-id-namespace-string"><a href="#build-id-namespace-string"><code>build-id-namespace</code> (string)</a></h3>
<p>An identifier unique to a package vendor, identifying a naming scheme for the
<code>build-id</code> property. The idea is that it makes sense to compare the build IDs
of two packages only if the packages have the same build ID namespace.</p>
<h3 id="confidentiality-string"><a href="#confidentiality-string"><code>confidentiality</code> (string)</a></h3>
<p>A string indicating confidentiality of the model. This can be used by package
databases for restricting access to a package, e.g. in case the model
specification is only accessible under a non-disclosure agreement. Publicly
available models can use <code>"Public"</code>.</p>
<p>Other values used in packages provided by Intel include <code>"Intel Confidential"</code>
and <code>"Intel Top Secret"</code>, but any string is permitted.</p>
<h3 id="files-object"><a href="#files-object"><code>files</code> (object)</a></h3>
<p>Describes the files to be distributed in the package.</p>
<p>For each file in the package, the object maps the <em>destination</em> path,
i.e. where within the installation the file should appear, to <em>source</em> path,
i.e. the absolute path of file on the local filesystem. The destination path is
a relative path, using <code>/</code> as directory separator and no <code>.</code> or <code>..</code> component,
whereas the source path is an absolute path using the host's path
conventions. I.e., on Windows, backslashes may be used in the source path but
not in the destination path.</p>
<p>If a destination path ends with <code>/</code>, it denotes a whole directory, and the
destination is given by an object instead of a string. This notation is
intended for cases when the exact contents of a directory cannot be determined
by the time the package specification file is created.</p>
<p>The destination object has three entries:</p>
<h4 id="source-directory-string"><a href="#source-directory-string"><code>source-directory</code> (string)</a></h4>
<p>Absolute path to a directory on the local filesystem where the files to be
packages are located.</p>
<h4 id="file-list-string"><a href="#file-list-string"><code>file-list</code> (string)</a></h4>
<p>Absolute path to a file on the local filesystem containing a complete list of
files to be distributed in this directory. The file is in JSON format and
contains a single list of strings, each one representing a file to be included
under this directory. Each string is a <code>/</code>-separated relative path without <code>.</code>
or <code>..</code> path elements, and denote the location relative both to the
<code>source-directory</code> and the destination path.</p>
<h4 id="suffixes-list-of-strings"><a href="#suffixes-list-of-strings"><code>suffixes</code> (list of strings)</a></h4>
<p>The <code>suffixes</code> property lists what file endings may be present among files in
<code>file-list</code>. It is often possible to know this in advance; if it is not, then
passing <code>[""]</code> as the set of suffixes denotes that any filename may appear.</p>
<p>The purpose of <code>suffixes</code> is to allow a reliable way of extracting a complete
list of files with a particular suffix from a package specification, before all
file lists have been generated. This is particularly useful for extraction of
reference documentation, which needs the set of <code>.so</code> or <code>.dll</code> files of a
package, but the set of files produced by the reference manual itself is
defined by a file list because its HTML file names are not known in advance. If
this file list declares a set of suffixes that does not include <code>.so</code> or <code>.dll</code>
files, then it is safe for the reference documentation extraction to not scan
this file list.</p>
<h2 id="optional-properties-of-package-specification"><a href="#optional-properties-of-package-specification">Optional properties of package specification</a></h2>
<h3 id="type"><a href="#type"><code>type</code></a></h3>
<p>Must be <code>"addon"</code>, unless you are building the base package (which is not
externally supported).</p>
<h3 id="disabled-boolean"><a href="#disabled-boolean"><code>disabled</code> (boolean)</a></h3>
<p>Default <code>false</code>. Controls the default behaviour of the <code>create-packages</code>
script, which is to create packages for all non-disabled packages.</p>
<h2 id="other-commonly-used-properties"><a href="#other-commonly-used-properties">Other commonly used properties</a></h2>
<p>These properties are ignored by packaging scripts, but may be used by other
tools.</p>
<h3 id="make-targets-list-of-strings"><a href="#make-targets-list-of-strings"><code>make-targets</code> (list of strings)</a></h3>
<p>Defines make targets to build in order to create the files needed to create
this package.</p>
<h3 id="doc-title-string"><a href="#doc-title-string"><code>doc-title</code> (string)</a></h3>
<p>Title to use in reference manuals. Often identical to the <code>name</code> property.</p>
<h2 id="module-cache"><a href="#module-cache">Module cache</a></h2>
<p>When Simics is installed on a network mount and the installation contains a
large number of modules, then it can take a long time to start Simics because
module scanning needs to examine a large number of files over the
network. Package specific module caches provide a remedy to this problem, by
collecting all module metadata of a package into one file.</p>
<p>The module cache file of a package is named
<tt><v>host</v>/lib/<v>Package-Name</v>.modcache</tt>, e.g.,
<code>linux64/lib/Simics-Base.modcache</code>.  The script <code>bin/create-modcache</code> can be
used to create this file. The script takes a package specification JSON file as
argument, and by default creates <code>.modcache</code> files for all packages defined
there matching the current host. It does so by inspecting the <code>files</code> property
of all packages. For each package that distributes a modcache entry with the
expected filename, it creates a modcache file on the path on the local
filesystem where the specification expects to find it. The modcache is created
by extracting module metadata from all module files distributed in the package.</p>
<p>Note that the module cache generation step needs to be done after all modules
have been built. Furthermore, Simics blindly trusts the package-level module
cache, so if a module is rebuilt after the modcache is generated, then any
updated module metadata will be ignored. Therefore, modcache generation should
normally only be done by packaging scripts.</p>
